MADos Arcanoid (in menu - MArcanoid)
Based on a C++ source written by Safronov Pavel found on http://www.progc.narod.ru

Known bugs:
- if the ball was directly punched too near from right or left wall it can start moving only around that wall. (occasional)

Todo:
- Fix bugs :)
- make that the ball reacts with cubes like a one big point. now it is reacting only with a point in the higher left corner.
- Some new levels (up to 40) (4 levels design is done, just to program)
- Bonuses: additional life, closed barrier, stone ball, big ball, glue, 2x and 3x length
- Handicaps: Block, invert screen, undo bonuses, 2x speed up

- implement difficulty level through timer ?
- optimize to take less space ?
